/**
 * Make sure the PS5 is running the payload that matches THIS app build,
 * pushing the bundled ELF if it's missing or a different version.
 *
 * Why both queues need this: each payload release carries server-side
 * hardening (e.g. v2.23.1 widened the mgmt accept backlog 8→128 and added
 * the reconcile connection-storm mitigations). Those only take effect once
 * the *payload itself* is redeployed. The install queue already did this; the
 * upload queue did not — so a queue run could hammer an old, fragile payload
 * with per-directory mgmt connections during reconcile and crash it after the
 * first job. Routing both queues through one check closes that gap.
 *
 * Never throws — on any failure it returns "no-push" / "stale-ok" and lets
 * the caller proceed with whatever payload is loaded.
